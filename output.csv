Dungeon Maker: Hunting Ground,"Jun 2, 2004",E,"(Known as ""Chronicle of Dungeon Maker"" in Japan)  An ambitious but novice dungeon maker arrives in a small town known to suffer periodic attacks from violent monsters. He buys a vast plot of land at the outskirts of the town to create a grand dungeon in hopes of luring in various enemy monsters which to hunt to collect gold and items. He envisions his complete dungeon to be one so appealing as to lure the legendary Wandering Demon. Defeating this menacing monster would free the townspeople from the fear he casts upon them, while winning acclaim as a true dungeon maker for the ""Architect."" The townspeople are initially skeptical about the Architect's ability to achieve his ultimate goal of building such a dungeon. Over the years, they've watched other such dungeon makers arrive with great plans but ultimately fail -- falling prey to the very monsters they've lured into their dungeons or haphazardly abandoning their creations. However, as the Architect's dungeon grows and improves, luring rarer and more powerful enemies, and he begins bringing back more valuable treasures, the townspeople begin offering support to his mission. Soon the whole town is involved in the dungeon making process; they give advice about the intricacies of dungeon making, sell crucial items, provide weapons and magic spells, treat the Architect when injured, and request various favors to be completed in the expanding dungeon in exchange for generous rewards. Whether the growing hopes of the townspeople and the Architect will be realized all depends on the quality of the dungeon he creates and his developing battle skills. Design and modify a customizable dungeon, floor-by-floor, using simple controls to quickly develop a deep and detailed dungeon. Strategically layout and improve your dungeon to maximize its attractiveness and lure in the most sought-after enemies to take their loot. Fight real-time battles wielding various melee and ranged weapons, casting magic spells, rendering special attacks, and summoning creatures to defeat the wide variety of monsters including undead creatures, orcs, and dragons. Enjoy the vast selection of building materials to customize your dungeon and complete quests to access the rarer items from the wide array of weapons, armors, and accessories to upgrade your warrior.

In a dystopian world that combines a dark underworld and elements of the fantastic, the player is required to infiltrate the gangs of Paradise City on behalf of a powerful government agency that, despite its influence, has been unable to introduce even a glimmer of law and order to this horribly corrupt city. In an intertwining chapter-driven story, the player takes turns controlling one of three gritty characters that, for their own reason, have ""volunteered"" to get to the bottom of the mystery behind the controlling crime syndicate's power. The player's characters becomes more powerful as they claw their way up the echelons of the underworld and as their individual stories begin to overlap. As the player's influence on the city grows, the businesses, the payoffs and the number of confrontations with rival gangs enables the player to gain experience and become powerful enough to take control of the city piece by piece. After becoming a underworld force to be reckoned with, the player discovers that the gang wars have been masterminded by a secret society, at the head of which are a coterie of terrifyingly dangerous and powerful figures that, it seems, no bullet will stop.

Ride to Hell: Retribution,"Jul 30, 2003",T,"The game is set in the last years of the roaring 1960s, a time of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. The biker movement, rock music and the hippie counterculture all add to the fascinating atmosphere to be experienced in Ride to Hell. Action-loaded from the very start with free roaming environments, players can immerse themselves in the liberty and freedom of riding full throttle with their gang on a multitude of different vehicles through the dusty flats of Western America. Protecting their turf, their brothers and their machines from rival gangs is just a taste of what this epic game involves. Ride to Hell is not for the faint-hearted; it's aimed heavily at the player who wants to become fully involved in the original West Coast biker culture. With its hard drinking, bare-knuckle environment, this is as close to the action as you can get. [Deep Silver]",Metascore 19 out of 100
